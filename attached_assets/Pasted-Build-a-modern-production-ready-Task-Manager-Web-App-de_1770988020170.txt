Build a modern, production-ready Task Manager Web App designed for a CS student who values clean UX, speed, and subtle aesthetics.

Core Concept

A minimal yet powerful productivity system combining classic task management with smart AI assistance. The app must feel lightweight, elegant, and distraction-free.

Design & Vibe

Visual style: soft, minimal, slightly edgy, calm but intelligent

Avoid loud colors and clutter

Smooth micro-interactions, polished typography

Feels like a blend of academic focus + creative journaling tool

Responsive across desktop + mobile

Functional Requirements

1. Task System

Create, edit, delete tasks

Fields: title, description, priority, due date, tags, status

Status types: todo, in progress, completed, archived

Drag-and-drop task movement

Subtasks support

2. Organization

3. AI-Enhanced Features

Natural language task creation ("Finish DSA assignment tomorrow")

AI task breakdown (split large tasks into steps)

Smart suggestions (detect vague tasks and refine)

Optional daily planning helper ("What should I focus on today?")

No heavy AI dependencies; assume API abstraction

4. Productivity Utilities

Deadline indicators / urgency logic

Progress visualization (simple, not flashy)
